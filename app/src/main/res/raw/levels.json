      "summary": "Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere, and the fluids of most living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds."
