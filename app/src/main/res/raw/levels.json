It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds."

The presence of deuterium gives the water different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it slightly different physical and chemical properties when compared to normal water."
